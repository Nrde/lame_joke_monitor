# lame_joke_monitor

A set of PHP and JavaScript codes to display the content of a mailserver on a custom website.
The scripts are e.g. used in the chemistry department of the TU MÃ¼nchen to display lame jokes in a chemical database. Users are asked to send lame jokes to a gmail address and these eMails are read out by fetch_mails.php (to display only the latest one) or show_all_jokes.php (to display a list of alle sent jokes).

If you want to use it, you have to include the mailserver details in both php files. Additionally, you have to include the JavaScript lines in scriplet.js to your website of interest.
